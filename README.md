## Introduction
 
Over the many years I've studied math and physics, I've noticed a distinct lack within my formal education. Topics, fields, objects, and tools that appear nearly universally in modern theoretical physics, yet are completely absent from the curriculum. Not just the pitifully tiny pool of undergrad material, but the thoroughly unimpressive graduate courses, which seem to only exist to justify the archaic practice of qualifying exams on outdated material.

Most physicists either ignore this discrepancy, or silently accept it. It is left unsaid among the successful, that if one is unwilling to read books and learn on one's own, they are certainly doomed if they wish to study theoretical physics. In these seemingly esoteric tomes on differential geometry, complex geometry, and representation theory lay the bare foundations of modern physics. Foundations that are brushed over by educators as unimportant. Happily ignoring that without these mathematics it is impossible to understand the most basic notions, like what is a vector, or that spin has nothing to do with quantum mechanics, and that these two facts are intimately related.

In the following, I will attempt to show you exactly what I mean by the above remarks. Instead of being as comprehensive as possible, I'll try to make it as simple as I can manage. I hope that I'm successful, and that the motivated student may follow along.
